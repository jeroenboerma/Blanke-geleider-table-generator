With these scripts it is possible to calculate the current for a certain equilibrium temperature for various conductor dimensions.
The dimensions can be listed in excel, most of the time two dimensions are needed per conductor, i.e. width and thickness or diameter and wall thickness.
In the properties file the type of conductor can be selected and the right excel file with row numbers corresponding to the list of dimensions in the excel.
In the Fun_total script the current for various equilibrium temperatures can be selected calculated.
